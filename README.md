# yaml-cpp and Cmake Playground

Experimenting with Cmake for using [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) to create a `.yaml` file.

Each branch contains different "solutions":

- `master`: a main file with the yaml related code commented out.
- `add-subdirectory`: `yaml-cpp` included through `add_subdirectory()`.
